The trajectory details the development of a full-stack Police Department Records Request Module. Initially, the AI engineer clarified core requirements from the user, establishing a need for role-based dashboards (Citizen, Staff, Admin) with authentication, request submission, tracking, and communication. The development proceeded in phases: first, building the foundational authentication and core request functionalities (dashboards, forms, detail views) using FastAPI, React, and MongoDB. After a successful initial build and comprehensive testing, the user requested significant enhancements.

The second phase focused on implementing file upload/download, email notifications, and an analytics dashboard, which the AI engineer successfully integrated into the existing architecture. Subsequent user feedback highlighted critical administrative needs, leading to the development of an Admin Panel for staff management, request assignment, and a master request list. The current state involves debugging the email notification system (due to a missing SMTP password) and addressing UI issues related to request details not displaying correctly on user dashboards, staff communication updates, and a request for an email template design mode. The AI is currently focused on systematically fixing these last reported issues.

<product_requirements>
The primary objective is to build a comprehensive Police Department Records Request Module. This system requires role-based access for Citizens, Police Staff, and Administrators.

**Core Functionality (Initial Request):**
*   **Citizen-Facing:** Submit public records requests, view their own submissions, track request status, and communicate regarding their requests.
*   **Staff-Facing:** Manage and respond to assigned requests, view unassigned requests, and communicate with citizens.
*   **Administrator-Facing:** Full oversight of all requests, assign requests to staff, manage users, and access system statistics.
*   **Authentication:** Secure login and registration for all user roles (Citizen, Staff, Administrator) using JWT.
*   **Notification System:** Automatic notifications for new requests (to admins), assignments (to staff), and status updates (to requesters).
*   **Communication System:** Real-time messaging between users and staff, with role-based access.
*   **Records:** Support for various record types (Police Reports, Incident Reports, Body Cam Footage, Case Files) with priority levels and status tracking (Pending → Assigned → In Progress → Completed/Denied).

**Enhancements (User Request after Initial Build):**
*   **File Upload & Download System:** Allow citizens to upload supporting documents and staff to attach/download response documents.
*   **Email Integration:** Automated email alerts for status changes, new assignments, and overdue requests.
*   **Analytics Dashboard:** Provide performance metrics, KPIs, and reporting for administrators.

**Administrator Specific Features (User Request after Enhancements):**
*   Review request assignments and assign requests to staff.
*   Add, enroll, delete, and edit staff members via an admin interface.
*   Access a master list of all requests with full details.
*   Control the look of email notifications (design mode).
*   Ensure request details (address, names, time, officers) are fully visible in review and on the user dashboard.

<current_work>
The immediate work involves debugging and fixing critical issues reported by the user after the implementation of the comprehensive administrative features. The user registered as a citizen but did not receive email notifications, which was traced back to an empty  in the  file. The AI has identified that the email system is currently in a development mode and logs emails to the console instead of sending them.

Additionally, the user reported several UI/UX issues:
1.  **Request Visibility:** A request made by a user is not appearing on their dashboard.
2.  **Detail Display:** Critical details like address, names, time, and officers are not being displayed in the request review section.
3.  **Staff Communication:** The staff information needs to be updated to enable communication for requests they are assigned to.
4.  **Email Template Control:** The user requested a design mode in the administrator dashboard to control the look of email notifications.

The AI acknowledged all these points and stated its intent to fix them systematically, starting with the  component, likely to address the detail display and dashboard visibility issues. The current focus is on these bug fixes to ensure the core functionality and administrative controls work as expected.
