# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

          comment: "✅ PASS: Registration security fix verified working. Account Type dropdown only shows 'Citizen' option as expected. Users cannot select staff or admin roles during public registration. Minor: Security message about admin/staff accounts is present in code but selector had issues during automated testing - message is visible in UI screenshots."

          agent: "testing"
          comment: "✅ PASS: Admin Panel User Management is functional. Admin can access User Management tab, view all users (26 total users displayed), see user details including roles and email addresses. Role selection dropdowns are present for changing user roles (Citizen/Staff/Admin). Email input fields available for updating user emails. Minor: Some UI selector conflicts during automated testing but functionality is working as expected."

This confirms the user reported issue. The data is available (shown in dashboard metrics) but not displaying in the Master Requests list/table. Admin panel tabs are accessible but request data is not populating in the Master Requests view."
        - working: true
          agent: "main"
          comment: "✅ CRITICAL ISSUE RESOLVED: Root cause was JWT token expiration (15-30 minutes) preventing proper admin panel access. Fixed by extending ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES from 30 to 480 minutes (8 hours) and fixing default fallback from 15 minutes. Backend testing confirms Master Requests endpoint now returns 46 requests with complete data structure. Dashboard stats show correct totals (46 requests, 35 pending, 3 completed, 39 users). Admin panel fully functional with all tabs accessible including Master Requests, User Management (84 delete buttons working), and Email Templates with react-quill integration."

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.
